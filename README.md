# Student Marks Prediction – Machine Learning Project<br>
 GitHub practice project.<br>
The project uses a Machine Learning model to predict student marks based on input features.<br>
It is created for learning and understanding basic machine learning concepts.<br>
This project is part of my hands-on practice to improve ML skills.
